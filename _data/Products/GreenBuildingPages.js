      "Reflective thermal insulation product, seamlessly integrated with concrete roof systems.",
    description: `During peak summer, concrete slab temperaturereaches around 60 to 65 °C. Under similar conditions, DHRT surface temperature reaches around 48° C. <b>DHRT</b> effectively reduces ( at full noon ) 12 to 17 °C surface temperatures of the slab, and thereby arrests solar heat absorption.Radiation effect of the slab is minimized (which take place from 5:00pm till late night) due to minimized heat gain of the slab. Thus <b>DHRT works as a RadiantBarrier</b>.<br/><br/>
    In winter since the sun's radiation is weak we get a temperature difference of only 2-3 Deg. or even less if there is fog. That means the temperature of the tile and bare slab are almost same and there is no excessive cooling. However since DHRT are insulating they can arrest the heat loss through the roof during winter.`,
